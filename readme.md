# News content Classification and Stock Price Analysis

## Project Summary

### News Content Classification
News content classification is the model for predicting News categories based on Headline, short Description, and Author. Here, the Headline, Short Description, and Author will represent features that will aid in predicting the Category. 

### Stock Price Analysis
The stock price is analysing past 20+ years' adjusted price data for prominent FAANG (Facebook (now meta), Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) securities. Based on the historical dataset, I have tried to analyse the most profitable securities amongst the FAANG group.
